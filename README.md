 Solo Project #5. Scrimba Frontend Dev career path course after completing CSS fundamentals.

 Requirements:
 1. Layout basics
 - add the image after the h1
 - center the text for the entire page
 - add a new div, give it a class, and assign it a width of 570px
 - center that div on the page
 2. Setting up font
 - add google font and configure it to work
 - Roboto light and black weights
 3. Setting up typography
 - set font sizes and weights for the various text to match the visual design
 4. Fancy it up
 - style the headings so that 'Sophie' and 'graphic designer' and 'article' should be bold and on their own line and a little larger than the rest of their respective headings are
 - style the link #99D930 and hover, focus #131313 and bold
 5. Adjust the spacing
 - top, middle and bottom sections each with their own background color that is full width
 - each section needs 100px of space on the top and bottom
 - top #D7D7D7 middle #FFEAEA bottom #EAF9FF (or your own colors if desired)
 6. Background colors... no really, I swear
 - previous colors were just placeholders, these are the real permanent colors
 - put a dark color to top and bottom
 - but... to do this you can only add classes to the HTML, NO other changes to the HTML allowed (CSS changes of course)
 7. Finer details
 - ensure space at top and bottom of each section is ONLY 100px
 - do not create any new selectors in the CSS to do this
 8. Adding buttons
 - add see my work link in mid section
 - add see all my articles link in bottom section
 - style both a normal and hover state that is 'button' like. normal = #99#930 with #252525 text. hover = #252525 with #fff text
 - don't use width or height to create the size of the 'button' looking links
